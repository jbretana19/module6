            <h2>Hello!</h2>
			<p>I'm a Michigan gal, currently soaking up the sweet, slow life near <a href="https://www.michiganbeachtowns.com/st-joseph/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lake Michigan</a>, a far cry from my former Chicago hustle. Let's just say, trading traffic jams for sunset strolls has been a major upgrade.</p>
			<p>My life's been a bit of a scenic route, if you will. I started with a degree in graphic design, because, you know, visuals! Then, because I apparently like collecting degrees like shiny Pokémon, I grabbed another in English. Why? Because words are magic! And now, I'm on a mission to conquer the library world with a Master&rsquo;s in Library Science. Yep, a lifelong library lover finally taking the plunge.</p>

          <h2>Present and Future</h2>
			<p>Currently, I'm wrangling data as a senior analyst for a home improvement retailer. Think of me as a digital detective, but instead of solving crimes, I'm figuring out what kind of drills people like. Before that, I dabbled in manufacturing, which was…an experience. Let's just say I learned the true meaning of "industrial strength."</p>
			<p>My grand plan? To become a librarian in my "golden" years. Because who wouldn't want to spend their days surrounded by books? And maybe, just maybe, I&rsquo;ll dabble in informational architecture, because organizing information is a superpower I'd love to refine.</p>
		  <p>I&rsquo;m a digital native, folks. Online learning? Been there, done that, got the virtual diploma(s). I&rsquo;m a big fan of learning on-demand, because who has time to wait?</p>
